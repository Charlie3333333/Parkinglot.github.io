    <h2>Main Questions</h2>

    <h3>Who is this site for?</h3>
    <p>
      This site is for students, faculty, staff, and visitors who drive to
      campus and want to find parking faster. 
    </p>

    <h3>How do I use this?</h3>
    <p>
      You should check the “Live Availability” page first. Then drive to the lot that
      still has open spaces and please check if you are allowed to park there.
    </p>

    <h3>Why is the number sometimes wrong?</h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes the data is slow processed to the website. If you see something that is not
      true, please go to the Report page and tell us. Thanks!
    </p>

    <h3>Do I still have to follow permit rules?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. There are so many parking rules on campus. You must still follow campus parking rules. This site does not
      replace official policy.
